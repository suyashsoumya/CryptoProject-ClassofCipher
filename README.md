# Cryptanalysis-Project
**_Applied Cryptography Project 1_**


*Testing Decryption (grading purposes)*:

Download Jin-Soumya-Xu-decrypt.cpp and dict.txt (place in the same directory as the ciphertext used to test our program for grading purposes)

Compile and Run Jin-Soumya-Xu-decrypt.cpp

Prompt for name of ciphertext used to test our program and which test (1 or 2)

*Just For Reference:*

generate folder: includes program that produces a text file (named dict.txt) with the words (in text file professor provided for test 2) ordered from least to greatest in terms of the sum of the word's letters' frequencies

encrypt folder: includes encryption programs that produce sample ciphertext files for testing purposes using text files the professor provided
